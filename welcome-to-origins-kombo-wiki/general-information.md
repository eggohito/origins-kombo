# General Information

In order to make a _"kombo"_ (key combination), you must first toggle _"Kombo mode"_ (key combination mode) by pressing either the Primary or Secondary ability keys once.

While in _"Kombo mode",_ the Primary and Secondary keys have their specific use-cases:

* You can press the Primary ability key to force-cast the _"kombo"_ you currently have,
* You can press the Secondary ability key to turn off _"Kombo mode"._
